# BIOI611 lab  

Welcome to BIOI 611! Iâ€™m excited to have you in this course, where we will delve into the fascinating world of transcriptomics and explore the intricacies of gene and transcript-level expression analysis.

This course focuses on the analysis of transcriptomics data, and specifically on the analysis of gene and transcript-level expression. Material covered includes transcript and gene expression estimation from RNA-seq data (short and long-read), basic experimental design and statistical methods for differential expression analysis, discovery of novel transcripts via reference-guided and de novo assembly, and the analysis of single-cell gene expression data (e.g., single-cell expression quantification, dimensionality reduction, clustering, pseudotime analysis). Prerequisite: BIOI 604. Core.
