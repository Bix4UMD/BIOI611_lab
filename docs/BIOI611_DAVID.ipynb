        "# DAVID Tool Suite Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The original version of DAVID introduced a tool suite designed primarily for batch gene annotation and GO term enrichment analysis, enabling researchers to identify the most relevant biological processes associated with a given gene list. While the core enrichment algorithm has remained consistent across all versions, the annotation coverage has significantly expanded. Initially limited to GO terms, DAVID now supports a wide range of annotation categories, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Gene Ontology (GO) terms\n",
        "\n",
        "* Protein–protein interactions\n",
        "\n",
        "* Protein functional domains\n",
        "\n",
        "* Disease associations\n",
        "\n",
        "* Biological pathways (e.g., KEGG, BioCarta)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Sequence features\n",
        "\n",
        "* Functional summaries\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tissue expression\n",
        "\n",
        "* Literature references, and more\n",
        "\n",
        "This expanded coverage allows researchers to explore their gene lists from multiple biological perspectives — all within a single platform. Results can be viewed as individual annotation chart reports or as combined summary reports, offering flexibility depending on the analysis goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "A notable feature of DAVID is its ability to accept custom gene backgrounds, which is rarely available in other web-based enrichment tools. This option enables more tailored and accurate analyses, particularly when comparing against a relevant experimental or platform-specific background rather than the whole genome."

        "\n",
        "When observations from two independent groups fall into two mutually exclusive categories, Fisher’s Exact Test can be used to determine whether the proportions differ between the groups. In DAVID, this test is applied to assess gene enrichment in annotation terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The p-value is computed by summing the probabilities of all contingency tables that are as extreme as or more extreme than the observed table:\n",
        "p = ∑A p, where A represents the set of relevant tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a 2 × 2 contingency table, the one-sided p-value is based on the frequency in the (1,1) cell (first row, first column), denoted as n₁₁. Under the right-sided alternative hypothesis, set A includes all tables where the (1,1) cell frequency is greater than or equal to n₁₁.\n",
        "\n",
        "A small right-sided p-value indicates that the observed frequency in the (1,1) cell is larger than would be expected under the null hypothesis of independence, suggesting an association between the row and column variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothetical Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the Human genome as the background, containing 30,000 genes — this is the Population Total (PT). Among these genes, 40 are known to participate in the p53 signaling pathway, referred to as the Population Hits (PH).\n",
        "\n",
        "Now assume that, in your experimental gene list of 300 genes — the List Total (LT) — three genes (List Hits, LH) are found to be associated with the p53 signaling pathway.\n",
        "\n",
        "The question is:\n",
        "\n",
        "➡️ Is the proportion 3/300 in our list significantly higher than the background proportion of 40/30,000?\n",
        "In other words, is this enrichment more than what would be expected by random chance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Fisher’s Exact Test is used in DAVID to statistically evaluate whether the observed enrichment of p53-related genes in the list is significant compared with the genomic background.\n",
