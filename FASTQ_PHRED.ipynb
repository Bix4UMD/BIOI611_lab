        "\n",
        "A Phred score is a measure of the probability that a base call in a DNA sequencing read is incorrect. It is a logarithmic scale, meaning that a small change in the Phred score represents a large change in the probability of an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Q = -10 \\cdot \\log_{10}(P)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Q is the PHRED score.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   P is the probability that the base was called incorrectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Q = 20**: This corresponds to a 1 in 100 probability of an incorrect base call, or an accuracy of 99%.\n",
